375 Aural Assaults is a tongue-in-cheek project. Ostensibly a celebration of the 375th anniversary of the founding of New Haven Connecticut, it is really an excuse to craft miniature soundscapes that emphasize the use of noise and non-standard synthesis methods using a minimum of code to achieve the desired results.

Many of the pieces employ variable delay lines with common modulation parameters to achieve both pitch-shifting and spatial effects. Listen with joy (and cautionâ€¦)
